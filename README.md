# I’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:

1. Lets you play tic-tac-toe.
2. Indicates when a player has won the game or if the game is drawn.
3. Stores a game’s history as a game progresses.
4. Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
5. When someone wins, highlights the three squares that caused the win.
6. Created a responsive web app which is compatible with all screen sizes.
7. For the current move, we show "You are at move #.." instead of button.
8. Added toggle button that lets player sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
9. Displays the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
