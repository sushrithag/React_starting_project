# I’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:

1. Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
2. Indicates when a player has won the game,
3. Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
4. Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
5. When someone wins, highlights the three squares that caused the win.
